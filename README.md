# wsl-cuda-whisper
The audio.whisper R package allows users to easily use OpenAI's Whisper model (e.g., for automated transcription of audio files) from R. Significant speedups can be achieved on machines with CUDA-enabled graphics cards, but setting this up can be complicated. This docker image allows a user on Windows to easily install all the dependencies needed to run audio.whisper with CUDA support via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). It is built on top of the rocker/tidyverse image, which means it comes with RStudio Server installed.

Versions:
- `jmgirard/wsl-cuda-whisper:vad` is a larger image that contains voice activity detection (VAD) via {audio.vadwebrtc} and {audio.vadsilero}. It also uses CUDA 11.8 as required by these packages.
- `jmgirard/wsl-cuda-whisper:novad` is a more streamlined image that does not contain VAD and uses the newest CUDA 12.6 version.

Usage:
1. Verify that your machine's graphics card supports CUDA: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus
2. On Windows, install the latest game-ready driver from NVIDIA: https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx#
3. On Windows, install the latest version of Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
4. Open Docker Desktop and click the Terminal button on the bottom of the screen
5. In the Terminal, type `docker pull jmgirard/wsl-cuda-whisper` (hit Enter and wait, it may take a while)
6. In the Terminal, type `docker run --gpus all --rm -it -e PASSWORD=pass -p 8787:8787 jmgirard/wsl-cuda-whisper`
7. If you want access to the Windows filesystem, you can add `-v "C:\Users\jmgirard:/data"` and then access `/data` in R
8. Once the Terminal has a line beginning with "TTY detected.", the container is ready
9. In Docker Desktop, click the Containers tab on the left and click the "8787:8787" link
10. Your browser should show a login page, enter "rstudio" as the username and "pass" for the password
11. You should now be shown the RStudio page, so enter `library(audio.whisper)` 
12. Now you can download and load whisper models via, e.g., `model <- whisper("tiny", use_gpu = TRUE)`
13. You can now use the `model` object and the `predict()` function with great speed
